    title: Big Data and Transportation
    abstract: >
        With the rise of population in cities, commutation by road or
        rail have become hard for people.Transit plays major role in
        public and private day to day life, but there are limited
        number of system to address the transportation issues. On
        other hand Big Data have proved to be more effective and
        helpful in most of the sectors and business. Big data is all
        about realizing full potential of large data set by acquiring,
        storing and managing by advanced technologies and optimizing
        techniques. With the help of new era of technologies like
        internet, social media, traffic camera,feeds and smart-phones
        one can have access to more real-time data which contains
        abundant of information, which can be used in transportation
        sector. We can use advance Big Data technologies like Spark on
        those real-time data set to address transportation issues to
        build next level Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

    title: Big Data and Sentiment Analysis
    review: Nov 17 2017
    abstract: >
        Opinion mining is an art of extracting opinions of author,
        speaker or writer
        from their written text or spoken words, opinion mining is
        done by employing
        Natural Language Processing ,text analysis, Artificial Intelligence.
        This paper
        shows where the Big Data meets Sentiment Analysis and the issues
        related in using
        Big Data in Sentiment Analysis. How the consumer needs and product
        evaluation is
        done while using Big Data in opinion mining.

        Nowadays decision making done by organization and individuals highly
        weighted on online
        reviews, social media opinions of any product or services. There is
        lot of valuable
        information available online, on which if proper mining technique is
        used we can reveal
        hidden values which are way useful to day to day life decision making.
        Given the usefulness of online data, individuals and group of people
        have
        started to take advantage of those data to boost up their business or
        products or creating an biased competition in market and this
        type of individuals and group of people create an opinion spamming
        system. Opinionated spamming are spams created by spammers to
        benefit their
        business fame or profit by giving biased reviews of product or service.
        Mechanism to detect these spammers or spam created by these spammers is
        an urgent need as we our technology has raised to new standard and
        raise
        in the rate of accessibility to online due to available technology.
        Here we are going to propose a such mechanism to detect fake review
        with
        help of an unsupervised machine learning model, which is trained using
        opinion
        mining of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Opinion mining is an art
        of
        extracting opinions of author, speaker or writer from their written
        text
        or spoken words, opinion mining is done byemploying Natural Language
        Processing ,text analysis, Artificial Intelligence.
