    title: Big Data and Transportation
    abstract: >
        With the rise of population in cities, commutation by road or
        rail have become hard for people.Transit plays major role in
        public and private day to day life, but there are limited
        number of system to address the transportation issues. On
        other hand Big Data have proved to be more effective and
        helpful in most of the sectors and business. Big data is all
        about realizing full potential of large data set by acquiring,
        storing and managing by advanced technologies and optimizing
        techniques. With the help of new era of technologies like
        internet, social media, traffic camera,feeds and smart-phones
        one can have access to more real-time data which contains
        abundant of information, which can be used in transportation
        sector. We can use advance Big Data technologies like Spark on
        those real-time data set to address transportation issues to
        build next level Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).
