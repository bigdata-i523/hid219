abstract="Feature ranking and feature selection algorithms may roughly be divided into three types. The first type encompasses algorithms that are built into adaptive systems for data analysis (predictors), for example feature selection that is a part of embedded methods (such as neural training algorithms). Algorithms of the second type are wrapped around predictors providing them subsets of features and receiving their feedback (usually accuracy). These wrapper approaches are aimed at improving results of the specific predictors they work with. The third type includes feature selection algorithms that are independent of any predictors, filtering out features that have little chance to be useful in analysis of data. These filter methods are based on performance evaluation metric calculated directly from the data, without direct feedback from predictors that will finally be used on data with reduced number of features. Such algorithms are usually computationally less expensive than those from the first or the second group. This chapter is devoted to filter methods.",
